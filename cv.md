### About me

One day I watch some funny video in youtube and I accidentally saw an ad with beautefull banner about Frontend developing...
And I want to try myself in development. I started learning with HTML and CSS. After a long time I try make up a layout and I have SUCCESS!!
As I studied layout, I tried to study English. But my written English is poor. It seems to me that my spoken English is much better than written.
I compose this with google translate :)
